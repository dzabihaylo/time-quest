# Milestones

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-02-13)

**Phases completed:** 2 phases, 6 plans, 13 tasks
**Timeline:** 2 days (2026-02-12 → 2026-02-13)
**Codebase:** 46 Swift files, 3,575 LOC
**Git range:** fa282fd → 9902b97 (23 commits, 9 feat commits)

**Key accomplishments:**
1. Complete estimation-first gameplay loop — player estimates task durations before doing them, performs tasks without a visible clock, and receives curiosity-framed accuracy feedback
2. Hidden parent setup with PIN gate — parent configures real routines (school mornings, activities) behind triple-tap gesture; player UI shows zero evidence of parent involvement
3. XP/leveling progression system — accuracy-based XP (never speed-based), concave level curve for fast early levels, "Time Sense" level display
4. Graceful streak tracking — daily participation streaks that pause on skipped days (never reset, never punish)
5. Sensory polish — haptic feedback on estimation and reveal, SpriteKit particle celebrations for milestones, game-framed notifications with player-controlled preferences
6. Accuracy trend charts and personal bests — Swift Charts line graph showing improvement over time, closest-ever estimate tracking per task

**Delivered:** A complete iOS game that trains time perception in a 13-year-old with time blindness through estimation practice, progressive difficulty via calibration, and sustained engagement through XP/leveling/streaks/charts — all without visible clocks, lectures about time blindness, or parental surveillance.
