# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** The player develops an accurate internal sense of time -- the ability to predict how long things take and act on those predictions without external prompting.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Advanced Training -- defining requirements

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.0 Advanced Training
Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-13 -- Milestone v2.0 started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 MVP:**
- Phases: 2, Plans: 6, Tasks: 13
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-02-12 → 2026-02-13)
- Codebase: 46 Swift files, 3,575 LOC

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full list with outcomes.

**v2.0 scope decisions:**
- Contextual insights: both in-gameplay AND dedicated "My Patterns" screen
- Self-set routines: guided creation with templates + customization (not full freedom)
- Bundle polish: real sounds, XP tuning, iCloud backup, weekly reflections

### Pending Todos

- Define v2.0 requirements (REQUIREMENTS.md)
- Create v2.0 roadmap (ROADMAP.md)
- Begin phase execution

### Blockers/Concerns

- Sound effects still placeholder .wav files (v2.0 will fix)
- XP curve constants need playtesting data (v2.0 will tune)
- iCloud/CloudKit integration is new territory -- needs research
