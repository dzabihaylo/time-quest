## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CloudKit + SwiftData integration needs real-device testing (MEDIUM, carried from v2.0)
- Test target not wired in generate-xcodeproj.js (tests written but not runnable via xcodebuild)
- Spotify Client ID configured -- full E2E test requires physical device (Spotify not available on Simulator)

## Session Continuity

No active session. v3.0 milestone complete.
