# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** The player develops an accurate internal sense of time -- the ability to predict how long things take and act on those predictions without external prompting.
**Current focus:** v3.0 Adaptive & Connected -- defining requirements

## Current Position

Milestone: v3.0 Adaptive & Connected
Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-14 -- Milestone v3.0 started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 MVP:**
- Phases: 2, Plans: 6, Tasks: 13
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-02-12 -> 2026-02-13)
- Codebase: 46 Swift files, 3,575 LOC

**v2.0 Advanced Training:**
- Phases: 4 (Phases 3-6), Plans: 8, Tasks: 19
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-02-13 -> 2026-02-14)
- Codebase: 66 Swift files, 6,211 LOC

## Accumulated Context

### Blockers/Concerns

- CloudKit + SwiftData integration needs real-device testing (MEDIUM)
- Test target not wired in generate-xcodeproj.js (tests written but not runnable via xcodebuild)
- Sound effects are synthesized tones; may want to replace with professionally designed sounds later
